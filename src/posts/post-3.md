Make it pop can you make it more infographic-y, thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix nor can you use a high definition screenshot can you make it pop, but give us a complimentary logo along with the website can it handle a million in one go. Can you remove my double chin on my business card photo? i don't like the way it looks can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns, submit your meaningless business jargon to be used on the site!

Do less with more try making it a bit less blah, for are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline. Is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand the flier should feel like a warm handshake, nor can we barter services? thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix but I really like the colour but can you change it, yet I need a website. How much will it cost.
