# 11ty template
Starter template for projects with 11ty, Sass, basic components

## Quick Start

1. [Generate a repo from this template](https://github.com/ahart14/template/generate) which will copy this project into your own new repo. _Note: You must be signed in to GitHub for this link to work_, else [visit the repo directly](https://github.com/ahart14/template/generate).

1. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty. Then run `npm start` to run 11ty in `serve` mode which will create a local server including hot-reload via BrowserSync.

   - Use `npm run build` to run a production version.

1. Open `src/_data/meta.js` and adjust the values to your details.

1. Edit `index.md` to change the home page, and then create content within `src/pages` using any templating format you prefer to add content.
